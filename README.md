# CSE-231-DIGITAL-LOGIC-DESIGN
 This course provides an introduction to logic design and basic tools for the design of digital logic systems. A basic idea of number systems will be provided, followed by a discussion on combinational logic: logic gates, Boolean algebra, minimization techniques, arithmetic circuits (adders, subtractors), basic digital circuits (decoders, encoders, multiplexers, shift registers), programmable logic devices (PROM, PAL, PLA). The course will then cover sequential circuits: flip-flops, state transition tables and diagrams, state minimization, state machines, design of synchronous/asynchronous counters, RAM/ROM design. An introduction to programmable logic will also be provided. Hands-on experience will be provided through project on design of a sequential logic system. This course has separate mandatory laboratory session every week as CSE 231L.  Course Objective: The objectives of this course are  to introduce Boolean logic operation and Boolean Algebra to teach students how to use Boolean Algebra and K-maps to realize two-level minimal/optimal combinational circuits to exposed students in the introductory design process of combinational and sequential circuits to teach the operation of latches, flip-flops, counters and registers. to explain how to analyze and design sequential circuits built with various flip-flops. to introduce using simulation tool for digital system design.
